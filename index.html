			<h2> About the Show </h2>
			<p class="p-homepage"> Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.
				<br> The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne.
				<br> The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne, the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

			<h2> A Song of Ice and Fire - GoT Book </h2>
			<p class="p-homepage"> A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos.
				<br> The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel.
				<br> Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros, 
				<br> and the ambition of the deposed king's exiled daughter to assume the Iron Throne.

				<ol>
					<li class="boxed">
						<p class="p-homepage"> "The season premiere of “Game of Thrones” was thoroughly satisfying,
							a transporting hour that brilliantly reestablished the chessboard for the new, penultimate season."
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="boxed">
						<p class="p-homepage"> "There are very few shows that can deliver as much action and excitement
						 as the season six Game of Thrones finale and there are perhaps even fewer shows that can make a table-setting episode this much fun, 
						 so it's all the more bittersweet that not only is winter here, but the end is in sight."
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="boxed">
						<p class="p-homepage"> "The show has stepped up its pacing. For the most part, that has been immensely satisfying, yielding crowd-pleasing
							moments that the and that the series generally avoided in the often-grim journey,
							 especially for the Stark kids, which has led to this point."
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="boxed">
						<p class="p-homepage"> "Everything that was always good about Game of Thrones is still good.
							The ensemble cast remains one of TV's richest, from top to bottom, and even actors who seemed weak in the past,
							continue to rise to the level of much better material."
